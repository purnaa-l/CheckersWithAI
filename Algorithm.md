# Minimax Algorithm in Checkers Game
The Minimax algorithm is a decision-making algorithm used in two-player, turn-based games, and is commonly applied in AI-based game development. It allows a player to make optimal decisions by evaluating all possible moves and their resulting outcomes. Below, we will explain how the Minimax algorithm is implemented in the Checkers game.

# Minimax Algorithm Overview
The Minimax algorithm explores all possible game states that can be reached from a given position. The algorithm alternates between two players: one who tries to maximize their advantage (the AI) and one who tries to minimize the maximizing player's advantage (the human player).

Maximizing player (AI): Tries to maximize their score and select the best possible move.
Minimizing player (Human): Tries to minimize the maximizing player's score, aiming to select the best counter-move.

The algorithm proceeds recursively by simulating all possible moves at each level and returns the optimal move based on the game's current state.

# Depth Control
In the provided code, the depth parameter controls how many moves ahead the Minimax algorithm should explore. Deeper depths will result in more accurate evaluations but will also be more computationally expensive. A typical value for depth in games like Checkers is around 3-5, depending on the performance trade-offs.
